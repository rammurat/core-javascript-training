Create a tabbed interface that allows the user to switch between tabs via click events. Think about the HTML and CSS first and progressively enhance using JavaScript.

Questions to ask yourself:
 - What HTML underpins this piece of UI?
 - How will this interface need to reflow for smaller/larger screens?
 - When it does, how do I manage this in JavaScript and CSS?
